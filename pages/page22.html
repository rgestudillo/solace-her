    <h1>when you are sick</h1>
    <p>
        treat yourself well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        sleep and rest as much as you can. do things that register as good for you. stay hydrated and drink your meds.
        you don't have to do anything. it's perfectly okay to skip chores for a day, what matters is your health.
    </p>
    <p>
        surround yourself with positive vibes. watch a favorite movie or listen to uplifting music. sometimes, a good
        laugh can be the best medicine.
    </p>

    <p>
        trust me, denying yourself any of that will not make itself felt immediately, but it will catch up to you.
