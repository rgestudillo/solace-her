    <h1>When you feel like crying</h1>
    <p>
        cry.
    </p>
    <p>
        you dont have to keep it all the time. for whatever reason, it's okay to sit down and release your emotions through tears.
        its okay if you dont know how to handle things right now. it's okay to cry even when you feel like it doesnt help. go cry for as long as you want, for as much as you can. 
        no matter what happens, 
        
        <b>everything will be alright, it always does.</b> 
        <br>
        one day you will wake up with no heavy hearts.

    <p>
        find solace in the fact that sometimes tears are the language your heart speaks when words fail.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i><b>let it all out. you'll be fine.</b></i>
