    <h1>When you can't sleep</h1>
    <p>
        there's a Japanese legend that says, "If you can't sleep at night, it's because you're awake in someone else's
        dream". so, whoops, my bad! HAHAHAHA
    </p>
    <p>
        kidding aside, try <b>Cognitive Shuffle</b>. Example:
        <br>
        <b>&nbsp&nbsp1. Random Letter</b>: Pick any letter, like 'B'.
        <br>
        <b>&nbsp&nbsp2. Word Play</b>: Imagine a calm 5-letter word starting &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith 'B,' say, "breeze."
        <br>
        <b>&nbsp&nbsp3. Word Chain</b>: Think of related words for each letter, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplike 'butterfly,' 'rain,' 'elephant.'
