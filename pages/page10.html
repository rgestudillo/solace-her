    <h1>When you need to make a decision</h1>

    <p>
        there's no way to know for sure you're making the best possible decision at every given point in your life.
        you're going to fuck up at some point and that's okay. 
        you'll learn from those mistakes.
    </p>

    <p>
        follow your instincts. you won’t always be right, but you’ll be staying true to yourself. 
        this won’t work for everything, but being decisive and efficient about these things will help you in the long run. 
        if you’re thinking about it too long, come back to it with a fresh mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        remember this, sometimes, confidence in your choice is more important than the choice itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i> make a decision,
        <br>
        and the universe will align accordingly.</i>
