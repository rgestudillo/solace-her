    <h1>When you're lonely</h1>
    <p>
        as long as i'm alive and breathing,
    </p>
    <p>
        you'll never have to lie awake at night wondering if anyone cares about you.

    <p>
        you'll never have to go to sleep feeling alone in this world
    </p>

    <p>
        and you'll never have to go another day without feeling cared.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>im here for you, <b>always.</b></i>
