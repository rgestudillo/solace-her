        <i>malayo pa, pero malayo kana.</i>

        let's always remind ourselves of this simple yet profound quote that can shift our perspectives in life.
        i know the journey towards our ultimate success may still be far, but what matters is that we've begun.
        never underestimate the daily hard work and efforts you put in because those sacrifices will yield fruits
        someday.
        when that time arrives, you'll be grateful for not giving up and for believing in yourself.
        life is not a competition; it's a test of courage, determination, and patience.
        taking that one step, making those tough decisions in life, is worth celebrating because you're one step closer
        to your dreams.
        so, even now, i want you to know that i am genuinely happy for you. i am proud of you.
