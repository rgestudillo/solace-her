    <p>
        stress is a sign that you care, but don't let it overshadow your capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        remember, it's okay not to have all the answers immediately. learning is a journey, not a race.
        take breaks, treat yourself kindly, and celebrate the small victories.

    <p>
        even though your situation right now is very difficult and so stressful, but promise, you will figure it out.
        i'm sure 5 years from now you are not gonna remember this situation because you've already surpassed it.
        you're in the right direction. keep going, and keep pushing.
    </p>

    <p>
        also, a study tip, only highlight things that are important. for example <span id="highlight-me"
            onclick="highlightSunshine()">click me</span>.
    </p>

    <p><b> <i>you got this <span id="sunshine"> Sunshine</span>, i'm rooting for you!!</b></i>
    </p>
</div>
<script>
    function highlightSunshine() {
        var sunshineSpan = document.getElementById("sunshine");
        sunshineSpan.classList.add("highlight");
    }
</script>
